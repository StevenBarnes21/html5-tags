<!DOCTYPE html> - This tag is used to tell the browser which type of file to expect. In this case it is telling the browser to expect HTML5.

<html> - This is the opening tag within which, all of your html markup will be placed either directly (children) or indirectly (grandchildren). This is not a self closing tag so there is also a closing tag which looks like this </html> 

<head> - This is the opening tag where all the details about the webpage should be put that are necessary for the running of the page but do not need to be displayed on the screen. This is where you put things like meta data and links to stylesheets and scripts. This is not a self closing tag and needs to be closed with a closing tag. </head>

Deciding if CSS should also be included in this file. Just testing out how branching works really ;)
